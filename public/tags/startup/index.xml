      <description>These notes are based on the talk given by Prasanna Sankar at NIT-Trichy, which can be found here. I have compiled notes on the 6 things which Prasanna believes can help us to be more successful and generate wealth. Please note that even though I have tried to capture the essence of the talk in these notes, it is possible that they are influenced by my understanding of the talk and I may have missed some things.</description>
