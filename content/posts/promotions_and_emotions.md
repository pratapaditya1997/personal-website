April 18, 2025 - 2:00 AM

It’s been 4 hours since my manager called and said - *“Congratulations, Aditya! You are an L5 now.”* It took two attempts but it’s here now. And strangely, the feeling is mostly the same as it was the last time - indifferent. Just a shade different: I was a little sad then, and I am a little happy now.

But why? That question has occupied my mind for the past two hours.

Why was I mostly indifferent both the times?\
Shouldn’t your promotion - something you have given 2-3 years of your life to - be something that warrants a strong emotion out of you? Honestly, I don’t have a concrete answer but I do have a vague sense of what I feel. I feel I don’t give much importance to these “material” results in life. I am not sure if promotion can be considered as a material result, hence the quotes. I feel it does. And this feeling isn’t something new. This has been the case with me for some years now.

Why was I a little sad the last time?\
Let’s rewind 6 months. I am in a meeting with my manager and my skip manager. I had a sense of the result already. My skip informed me that I wasn’t promoted and they tried their best. They were sad. Their emotions weren't fake, I could see it. After the meeting, my manager pulls me aside outside the meeting room and puts his hand on my shoulder. He tells me how much they both tried to push my case, and how they both genuinely believe I am almost there with little more boxes to tick and how I should not lose heart. Funnily enough, I was completely okay before this conversation. But seeing my manager being so sad made me sad too. Here were two people who had put so much faith in me, believed in me. And I felt I had let them down.

Why am I a little happy this time?\
My manager is super happy while announcing the news to me in the call. My skip manager calls me immediately afterwards and he is super happy too. My TL messages and she is super happy too. WhatsApp was buzzing on the side. Close friends call and they are super happy too. This happiness rubbed off a bit on me too. Their happiness made me realize that maybe I should be happy too. Maybe I shouldn’t be so indifferent all the time to myself.

Gratitude.\
One emotion that constantly stands out both the times is - gratitude. We often don’t realize how many of the achievements we so happily take the credit for, actually comes from the help, guidance and support of so many people. I feel the only thing that I can give myself the credit for is the set of amazing people I am surrounded by in life. We grow up watching TV shows where managers & TLs are painted as credit stealing vamps. Luckily, my experience, throughout my career so far, has been exactly the opposite. I genuinely believe that promotions - or any growth in life - are impossible without the people close to us.\
I know I have only mentioned work folks so far, but if I go a little back, the list of people I am grateful to is such a long list. The fact that I could even reach Google in the first place happened because of so many serendipitous moments scattered throughout my life. And how could you not be grateful to all of them?

As [Shah Rukh once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aabi089viZw&ab_channel=NDTV) - **“On your own, I believe, you are not unique, you are just alone. So, gratitude should be an attitude.”**\
And as for my life: **“Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.”**
