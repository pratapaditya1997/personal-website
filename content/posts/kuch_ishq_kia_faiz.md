## कुछ इश्क़ किया कुछ काम किया 

Do you find yourself in situations where you think you haven’t given your 100%, where you feel your efforts were half-hearted, you really wanted to give it your all but couldn’t because of other commitments? And at the end, tired, you just leave it incomplete..

Personally, I feel I’ve been in these situations sometimes, and I get angry or disappointed with myself. But before we start being too hard on ourselves, maybe let’s read what the great Faiz Ahmad Faiz has to say.

| वो लोग बहुत ख़ुश-क़िस्मत थे    | Fortunate indeed were those           |
| जो इश्क़ को काम समझते थे     | Who regarded love as work             |
| या काम से  आशिक़ी करते थे    | Or were in love with their work       |
| हम जीते जी मसरूफ़ रहे        | I remained busy my entire life        |
| कुछ इश्क़ किया  कुछ काम किया | And managed some love, with some work |
| काम इश्क़ के आड़े आता रहा     | Work came in the way of love          |
| और इश्क़ से काम उलझता रहा   | And love got intertwined with work    |
| फिर आखिर तंग आ कर हम ने    | At last, in exasperation              |
| दोनों को अधूरा छोड़ दिया    | I left them both half done            |
| - फैज़ अहमद फैज़             | - Faiz Ahmad Faiz                     |

English translation from https://brown.edu/Research/poetry-in-translation/2017/06/21/body-pakistan/

There are many ways to interpret Ishq (इश्क़) and Kaam (काम) in the poem. First is the quite literal tussle between love and work, which reveals a conflict between the heart (इश्क़) and the mind (काम) of the poet. While the former pines for the beloved, the latter focuses on work (i.e. job, career, business etc.)

Another way to see this is the dilemma we face between our reasons (काम) and emotions (इश्क़). As beautifully explained in her [article](https://brown.edu/Research/poetry-in-translation/2017/06/21/body-pakistan/) by Mehak Burza -

> “The poet here can be seen as the body faced with the same dilemma, oscillating between the workings of mind (reason) and heart (emotions). On one hand, is his love for his beloved, while on the other, is his work. This is the reason he calls those people fortunate and privileged that either love their work or consider love as their work. Unfortunately, for the poet, the conflict between heart and mind becomes too much to handle as both keep intertwining with each other, and as the conflict reaches its apex, it forces him to leave both undone; thus falling prey to the conflict of reason and emotions.”

It makes you think: if someone as great as Faiz Ahmad Faiz, after such an outstanding body of work and an exceptional life, thinks he has left things incomplete, then maybe that is how it is supposed to be.
