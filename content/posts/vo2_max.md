## What is VO2 max?
V = volume\
O2 = oxygen\
Max = maximum

VO2 max = maximum oxygen consumption rate. How much oxygen we can intake and use during exercise.

Measured in mL/kg/min. Maximum amount of oxygen (in mL) that our body is able to use per minute per kg of our body weight.

## Why does VO2 max matter?
- Oxygen is the key fuel for our muscles during most cardiovascular exercise. Our muscles use oxygen to produce energy for muscular contractions.
- The more oxygen we consume, the more oxygen we can send through our blood to our working muscles. The more oxygen in our muscles, the more energy is produced.
- VO2 max is not the only performance variable. Other variables such as running economy and lactate threshold affect performance.
- Think of VO2 max like the efficiency of our own internal engine.
> "A high VO2 max is like a car with a bigger engine. A car with a smaller engine has to work harder to go as fast as the big engine"\
\- Matthew Meyer, a coach.

## How to improve VO2 max?
### Interval Training
Interval training can boost VO2 max. During interval workouts, the intensity is hard enough during the intervals that we reach our maximum aerobic limit. By spending time training at our VO2 max, our body adapts and increases VO2 max over time. Similar to interval sessions, tempo runs are helpful as well.

### Endurance Training
Increasing our mileage with mostly easy runs will boost our VO2 max. Easy runs are entirely aerobic. The more easy runs we do, the more our aerobic (means “with oxygen”) system adapts. When our aerobic system improves, then our VO2 max improves.

### High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
HIIT forces us to reach or temporarily surpass our anaerobic threshold before returning to a lower, aerobic intensity. This type of overload causes our heart and lungs to adapt to the demands we are imposing on them.
